# PPT M57 60mm Mortar - Self Firing

**AS_M57_AutoMortar** is a standalone Arma 3 mod featuring the Serbian M57 120mm mortar, equipped with a fully scripted semi-automatic firing system.
The mortar requires a crew to load shells manually, but does not need a gunner or player interaction to fire â€” once the shell is inserted, it automatically launches.
Ideal for automated fire support, immersive scenarios, and advanced mission scripting.
